# Boolean Operators

Boolean = 1 OR 0

-and: takes two Booleans, returns true if both Booleans are true
                x > 5 and x < 15 => True
-or: at least one of the Booleans used are true
                x > 5 or x > 15 => True
-not: negates Boolean value used.

NumPy arrays cannot be compared or asked about normally. Use the following:
  -logic_and
  -logical_or
  -logical_not
    
    ***
    # and, or, not (1)
# Define variables
my_kitchen = 18.0
your_kitchen = 14.0

# my_kitchen bigger than 10 and smaller than 18?
print(my_kitchen > 10 and my_kitchen < 18)

# my_kitchen smaller than 14 or bigger than 17?
print(my_kitchen < 14 or my_kitchen > 17)

# Double my_kitchen smaller than triple your_kitchen?
print(my_kitchen * 2 < your_kitchen * 3)

    # Boolean Operators with Numpy

# Create arrays
import numpy as np
my_house = np.array([18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50])
your_house = np.array([14.0, 24.0, 14.25, 9.0])

# my_house greater than 18.5 or smaller than 10


# Both my_house and your_house smaller than 11
